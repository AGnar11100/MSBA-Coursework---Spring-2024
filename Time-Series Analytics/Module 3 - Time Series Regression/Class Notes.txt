Regression models for: 
trend component - linear, exponentil, polynomial etc
seasonal component - additive or  multiplicative 
Fitting trend + seasonal components
Capturing special events
capturing period-to-period - autoregressive
And are useful for: visualization and multi-period forecasting
Regression is good for long periods unlike models that use exponential smoothing 

For multiplicative series, exponential trend is advised 

Most common way to capture seasonality in a regression model is to create a new categorical variable that describes season for each month
for monthly data. So apply binary variable.
When binary variables are present, the model cannot be considered to be linear and is considered non-linear.
