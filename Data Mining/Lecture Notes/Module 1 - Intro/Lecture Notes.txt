Data Mining refers to advanced business analytics methods of predictive analytics that go beyond counts, descriptive 
analytics, reporting, and methods based on business rules. Included both stats and ML methods that inform
decision making, often done in an automated fashion

Prediction is typically an important component
	Rather than what is the relationship btwn advertising and sales, we might be more intrested in what specific advertisement 
	or product recommendation should be shown to a given shopper.

	Maybe interested in clustering customers into different categories that receive different marketing treatment then assigning
	each new prospect to one of these categories.

DM stands at the convergence of the fields of stats and ML
Statistics include a variety of techniques for exploring and building models like linear regression, PCA, and discriminant analysis.

Main difference btwn Stats and DM
	Stats focuses on inference from a sample to the population regarding the population mean or pop std
	The main idea of DM is on predicting individual records
	The core tenets of classicial stats DO NOT apply in DM apps where both data and computing power are available
	DM works with large datas
Data mining is statistics at scale and speed!

DM utilizes machine learning that applies various algos that learn directly from data, especially local data (like clusters), often in
layered and iterative fashion.
	Example ML methods: classification trees, NNs, cluster analysis

In constrast, stats models refer to methods that apply global structure to the data.
	Example: Linear regression, where a record would be treated by linear regression in accord with an overall linear equation that
	applies to all the historical records.
	Contrary to that, in the classification tree method, that record will be classified in accord with the values of a small
	number of nerby records.

Many practioners, particularly those from the IT and CS communities, use ML to fere to all methods used in DM.

Classification
	most basic form of data analysis
	goal is to predict categortical target (outcome) variable
	Ex: purchase/no purchase, etc etc

Prediction
	Goal is to predict the value of a numeric variable
	Ex: amount of purchase

Association rules and collaboritive filtering
	Association rules (affinity rules) identify connections amoung groups of items in an independent event or tranaction
		Primary purpose is to determine which of the items are commonly sold together
		Recc Systems - Our record should you bought X, you may also like Y

	Collaberative filtering is popular in online recommendation systems like Amazon and Netflix, to generate, based on individual
	user' preferences, rules general to an entire populations, "what goes with what"
`		Based on the notions of identifying relevent items (filtering) for a specific user from a very large set of items by considering
		preferences of many users (collaboration)

Predictive Analytics
	Combination of classification, prediction, and to some extent, association rules and collaberative filtering consistutes
	predictive analytics
	According to some sources, can also include clustering

Data reduction and dimension reductions
	Distillation of complex/large data into simpler/small data, eg sampling.
	Reducing the number of variables/columns, eg PCA
	Reducing the number of records/rows, eg clustering

Data exploration and visualization
	Datasets are typically large, complex and messy
	Need to review the data to help refine the task
	Data exploration uses techniques of reduction and visualization
	Visualization includes graphs and plots of data, eg histograms, boxplots, bar chars, scatterplots
	Visualization is especially useful to examine relationships between pairs of variables

Supervised Learning: predict a single target variable
	Classification and Predictions

Unsupervised Learning: segment data into meaningful segments; detect patterns
	Association rules, clustering, text mining, data reduction, exploration and visualization

These are sometimes used in conjunction
	Separate loan applications into several risk-lvel groups (unsupervised) and then for each group
	identify loan default propensity (supervised)

Steps in Data Mining
1) Develop understanding of purpose of DM project
2) Obtain data for analysis (or random sampling)
3) Explore, clean, preprocess
4) Reduce the data dimensions, if necessary
5) Determine DM task(s) (prediction, classification, clustering, etc.)
6) Partition data (for supervised tasks)
7) Choose the DM technique(s)/model(s) eg regression, decision trees, NNs, etc
8) Use selected techniques and associated algos to perform the tasks (iterative processes using multiple variants, i.e. different
variables, settings, and validation performance
9) Interpret the results of techniques/modes and assess the techniques - compare them and select the best one
10) Deploy the best technique (model) into the operational system
