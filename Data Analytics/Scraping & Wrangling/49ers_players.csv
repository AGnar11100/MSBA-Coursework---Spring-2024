Name,Biography
Brandon Aiyuk,"His last name is pronounced EYE-yook.Aiyuk is only the second alum from a Northern Nevada high school to become a first-round NFL draft pick. Former DT Shawn Knight (Reed HS, NV) was drafted by the New Orleans Saints 11th overall in the 1987 NFL Draft.Though he grew up in Nevada, Aiyuk has roots in Northern California. He attended Sierra (Rocklin, CA) College from 2016-17, where the 49ers spent training camp from 1981-1997. Additionally, Aiyuk began supporting the 49ers at a young age, thanks to his mom. ""My mom's been a huge 49ers fan her whole life, so that kind of bled on me a little bit when I was younger,"" said Aiyuk. When he got the call informing him that he would be a member of the team, Aiyuk realized a childhood dream that he wasn't sure would come true. ""There were a lot of people telling me before today and all week that it was going to happen. So, it's crazy that it actually did happen.""During his time at Sierra College and later Arizona State, Aiyuk was known for his work ethic on and off the field. Ben Noonan, who coached Aiyuk at Sierra College, found Aiyuk in the weight room constantly, improving his squat from 275 pounds coming out of high school to 500 pounds by May 2017. That drive carried over to the practice field, where Aiyuk routinely stayed for 30 minutes after every practice working on routes in the Rocklin heat. ""It gets up to a good 110 degrees, and then he's out there until the daylight is gone with the quarterbacks after a four-hour day,"" Noonan said. ""And demanding that the quarterbacks stay, you know, whether their arm was falling off or not."""

Arik Armstead,"Lists his parents, Guss and Christa, as the most influential people in his life. He also gives credit to his grandfather, Willie B. Armstead, an Air Force veteran, for instilling the value of integrity that his parents have passed along to him. ""A lot of things he instilled in my dad have carried down to me. Having a family member who is more courageous than you can imagine and who served his country is a huge honor.""Played both basketball and football at Oregon before focusing only on football in 2014. During Super Bowl 50's Media Day, Armstead joined Sacramento's ABC10 sports team as a reporter to learn what it is like to cover NFL players during one of the most hectic events of the year. Held at SAP Center in San Jose, Armstead interviewed former teammates, fans, media members and Miss Universe. ""It's like a feeding frenzy - everyone running around, and being part of that frenzy was a unique experience,"" said Armstead during the event.For Armstead, the NFL Draft process was a whirlwind tour. He went straight from the National Championship Game to San Diego to prepare for the NFL Combine and then to Sacramento for the Draft itself. However, his favorite part of the process was being drafted by a team so close to his hometown. ""It's a dream come true. I'm blessed to be in this situation. Not a lot of other people are that close to home. Being able to play home games in front of my family is perfect for me.""In May of 2020, Armstead donated $50,000 to Sacramento's Mercy Housing for students to be able to participate in distance learning. The donation will provide 350 Chromebooks to students, as well as one-year of pre-paid internet service for those families, many of whom have multiple students in their households. Also included in the donation were education kits consisting of learning activities, books, supplies and even healthy snacks benefiting children of all ages who remain physically at home, unable to visit their schools because of the coronavirus pandemic. ""These are things that people should have access to, these are things that students in other communities do have access to, so this is just a baseline of essential needs for them to be successful in the classroom,"" said Armstead. ""I think people need to realize that some of the things we're experiencing right now maybe the new norm, even when the virus calms down."" Armstead took the time to personally deliver the Chromebooks to the recipients of the donation. ""A lot of students had been disengaged before the pandemic, but even more so with school getting canceled and having to learn virtually and not having the technology and access,"" said Armstead. ""I'm happy that I launched the foundation last year so that I could try to address some of these issues in my community.""During the 2020 offseason, Armstead began implimenting several installments of Storytime with Arik Armstead using virtual platforms. For Earth Day, Armstead surprised a virtual classroom of 20 second-grade students with a story time, Q&A and conversations about the environment. For Mother's Day, he and his mom, Christa, read ""Guess How Much I Love You"" on the 49ers Instagram account. Education is at the forefront of Armstead's commitment to the Bay Area, as the defensive lineman founded the Armstead Academic Project to ensure every student, no matter their socioeconomic status, has direct access to a quality education through a positive learning environment and resources needed in order to thrive and be successful.Armstead returned to his hometown of Sacramento during the 2019 offseason to host the second charity weekend for his foundation, Armstead Academic Project, which promotes equal opportunities through education. The festivities kicked off as teammates Ronald Blair III, Richard Sherman, Jaquiski Tartt and Ahkello Witherspoon joined Armstead for a charity gala and silent auction which raised more than $100,000. Armstead then led a youth camp the following morning, where the children were able to get hands-on lessons from the NFL players. Throughout the day, Armstead stressed the importance of hard work, sportsmanship and teamwork.NFL players had the opportunity to participate in the NFL's annual My Cause, My Cleats campaign during Week 14 of the 2019 season. Armstead and his teammates represented their respective causes with custom-designed cleats in an effort to raise awareness and funding. In choosing the foundation Arik Armstead Academic Project which focuses on education equity, ""I play for all children to have the right to quality education,"" said Armstead.NFL players had the opportunity to participate in the NFL's annual My Cause, My Cleats campaign during a designated home game between Weeks 13-15 of 2018. Armstead and his teammates represented their respective causes with custom-designed cleats in an effort to raise awareness and funding.In April of 2018, Armstead worked with Leataata Floyd Elementary and 916 Ink to host a trip to the Imaginarium, where the young students developed their artistic abilities, while learning how to be better at communicating. The event was in conjunction with Armstead's foundation, which focuses on assisting at-risk youth, particularly through the means of education.Armstead returned to his hometown of Sacramento this past offseason to host the second charity weekend for his foundation, Armstead Academic Project, which promotes equal opportunities through education. The festivities kicked off as teammates DeForest Buckner, Ronald Blair III, Richard Sherman, Sheldon Day, Jaquiski Tartt and Ahkello Witherspoon joined Armstead for a charity gala and silent auction which raised more than $100,000. Armstead then led a youth camp the following morning, where the children were able to get hands-on lessons from the NFL players. Throughout the day, Armstead stressed the importance of hard work, sportsmanship and teamwork.Members of the 49ers defensive line spent time with 25 local youth from the Fam 1st Foundation at Shoe Palace for a special holiday shopping experience on December 16, 2019. The Fam 1st Foundation is based in Oakland and focuses on underserved youth, aiming to build new generations of innovative thinkers to create solutions for the future of Oakland and beyond.In 2017, Armstead returned to his hometown of Sacramento to hold his Annual free youth football camp. The camp was held in Elk Grove, CA and sponsors made it possible for 200 scholarships to be offered to interested kids. The kids participated in both football and conditioning drills with the players and then were allowed to ask questions to discuss not only football, but school, healthy choices, and other topics. Armstead's goal was to provide campers with a unique experience on the football field, as well as insight into the hard work and dedication that are needed to make it to the NFL. ""I want the kids to enjoy themselves while also coming away learning that they can do whatever they put their mind to,"" said Armstead. ""I want to teach them the things that helped me get where I am now like the importance of education, work ethic, and faith.""If Armstead wasn't in the NFL, he would be playing basketball. He was a three-year starter in basketball at Pleasant Grove High School in Sacramento and played two years at the University of Oregon before focusing solely on football for the 2014 season. He entered his high school senior season listed as the number three prospect in NorCalPrep.com's Top 40 rankings for the class of 2012. ""A big part of the recruiting pitch from Oregon was they were going to let me play two sports. We only lost 5 games during my time there. I wanted to go somewhere with the chance to win and be a part of something special.""Armstead's brother, Armond, was forced to retire before ever playing a down in the NFL. After playing collegiately at USC, Armond became an All-Star for the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League, helping the team win the league's 100th Grey Cup. He went on to sign with the New England Patriots in 2013, but medical issues forced him to hang up his cleats. ""The biggest thing he has told me through this process is, 'at the end of the day, it's just football.' Having a brother who played at this level makes everything less overwhelming.""In April of 2018, Armstead worked with Leataata Floyd Elementary and 916 Ink to host a trip to the Imaginarium, where the young students developed their artistic abilities, while learning how to be better at communicating. The event was in conjunction with Armstead's foundation, which focuses on assisting at-risk youth, particularly through the means of education.Armstead and his teammates joined Levi's in support of breast, colon and pediatric cancer warriors at the Crucial Catch Fashion Show presented by Dignity Health in October of 2018. 49ers players and cancer warriors took to the runway to show off their attire and share their stories of strength and courage with the audience."

Early in his football career, Cheryl watched from the sideline at practice as Nick approached a coach. ""I find out later they'd put Nick with the offense,"" she recalled.

""It was really my dad that got me into it,"" said McKivitz. ""He's got me into everything in the outdoors, really. That's me and dad's time, the outdoor time. I'm just lucky to have that type of figure to learn from and that's kind of what I love most about the outdoors."" Matt is known for creating unique hats from the animals the two of them have hunted. The elder McKivitz is famous for being seen sporting one at each of West Virginia's home games.While the Mountaineers were on a bye in September of 2019, McKivitz returned to his former high school, Union Local, in Ohio to be honored at the homecoming game.

One of her goals was to finally get her college degree after struggling in college during her youth. Deebo, like with the other members of his family, was there to support her, often helping her with her homework. ""Deebo used to help me a lot with my math courses, he's real good in math,"" said Martin. ""They've seen me working hard as far as working and working hard at school, a lot of sacrifices I had to make and a lot of things I had to miss out with them. I think that plays a major part in my children wanting to further their education.""

To honor his memory and expand the awareness and prevention of diabetes, Williams began to serve as an ambassador for the American Diabetes Association in 2014, and has done so ever since in order to help others focus on the importance of wellness in life. ""As we all know, it affects a lot of Americans, not just around the world, but in America we have almost 30 million people living with the disease,"" Williams said. ""It's almost catastrophic, and it can be without the right awareness. Obviously, I lost my grandfather at a young age to this disease, so I have a special interest in working with the ADA every year. To me, I feel like it's something that I have to do,"" Williams said. ""I owe it to my family and to myself to do.""In June of 2018, Williams hosted the 5th Life and Skills Camp, also known as Silverback football camp, at Lobo Stadium in his hometown of Longview, Texas.

""Never in my wildest dreams did I ever imagine getting my jersey retired, especially at a high school like this that's rich in tradition in football. To know that I've done enough in my career, and I feel like I've got a lot left to do, to have my jersey retired, it's a blessing.""Throughout his career, Williams has made it a priority to assist and help those who shaped him in his younger years.

Wishnowsky and some of his teammates joined the students at Williamson Elementary School to talk about inclusion and anti-bullying. The players spoke at an assembly before helping the kids write compliment cards and discuss how to be kind to one another.While working as a glazier, a glass installation specialist, in his native Australia, Wishnowsky's friends began showing him NFL games. After a couple years, he decided to leave his job and move to Melbourne to join ProKick Australia, a training academy for aspiring punters. Founded by Nathan Chapman, an Australian who once had an opportunity with the Packers, the academy has had massive success, with about 50 punters on Division I scholarships. Though the technique required for punting is a learning process, Wishnowsky thinks he and his fellow Australians have the ability to excel thanks to the sports he played growing up, like Australian rules football, track, and soccer. ""While Americans grow up wanting to throw the ball, we grow up trying to kick 60-yard goals,"" he said. ""Sure, the techniques are slightly different, but the swing of your leg is pretty much the same. We have that muscle memory drilled into us from a young age.""Wishnowsky is a naturally talented athlete, whether it is something that requires pure strength or skill. In Australia, he was constantly getting involved in various sports from a young age. While he participated in universally popular athletics, like soccer and rugby, he enjoyed any sort of competition. When he was 12 years old, he won a major West Australian Billiards tournament. Before shifting to football in the United States, he was a member of a local semi-pro team in the West Australian Football League. While at Santa Barbara Community College, he found that his ideal conditioning was a mix of hitting the weight room and playing beach volleyball with his teammates.Participated in the 49ers Annual Community Day, helping pack more than 31,000 nutritious meals in collaboration with Feeding Children Anywhere.

""I think a lot of it was just being outside playing,"" he said. ""Mom and Dad would make us stay outside for the whole day. We'd go inside to get water and they'd just shove us right back outside. We were always in the woods running around."""
