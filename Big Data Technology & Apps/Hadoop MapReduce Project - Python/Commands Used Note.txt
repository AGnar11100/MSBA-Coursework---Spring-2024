Part I: Develop a Python application to retrieve Year and Temperature from original NCDC records and then write the 
Year and Temperature data into a text file. 

# put data into correct directory
hdfs dfs -copyFromLocal CourseProjectData/ hdfs://msba-hadoop-name:9000/user/student29/
# run mapper 
spark-submit NcdcRecordMapper.py CourseProjectData/*.gz
# run reducer
spark-submit --master local[*] NcdcRecordReducer.py





Part II: load the text file into Pig and get the highest and lowest temperatures for each year.
temperature_data = LOAD 'hdfs://msba-hadoop-name:9000/user/student29/output/aggregated_temperature/part-00000' USING PigStorage(',') AS (year:int, temperature:int);
grouped_data = GROUP temperature_data BY year;
temperature_stats = FOREACH grouped_data { max_temp = MAX(temperature_data.temperature); min_temp = MIN(temperature_data.temperature); GENERATE group AS year, max_temp AS max_temperature, min_temp AS min_temperature; }
STORE temperature_stats INTO 'output/temperature_stats' USING PigStorage(',');
DUMP temperature_stats;


Part III: load the text file into Hive and get the average temperature for each year.
hdfs dfs -mkdir /home/student29/hivedb
then 
hdfs dfs -copyFromLocal sample.txt /home/student29/hivedb/
then
ls -l | grep meta
then
mv metastore_db metastore_db.old
then 
schematool -dbType derby -initSchema
then 
hive
then 
set hive.metastore.warehouse.dir;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS temperature_data (year INT, temperature INT) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' STORED AS TEXTFILE;

LOAD DATA INPATH 'hdfs://msba-hadoop-name:9000/user/student29/output/aggregated_temperature/part-00000' INTO TABLE temperature_data;

SELECT year, AVG(temperature) AS avg_temperature FROM temperature_data WHERE year IS NOT NULL AND temperature IS NOT NULL GROUP BY year;
Deliverables:
	1) Python files (mapper and reducer): DONE EZ
	2) the commands for executing the Python application in Hadoop: DONE EZ
	3) the text file including Year and Temperature data created by you: write both output files into a text file
	4) the screenshot of the text file being created: EZ
	5) the screenshot of the final Pig output showing the year and the highest and lowest temperatures: confirm output
	6) the screenshot of the final Hive output showing the year and average temperature: confirm output
